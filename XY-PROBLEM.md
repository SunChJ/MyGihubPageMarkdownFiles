title: The X-Y PROBLEM (XY-问题)
---
### The universal problem during life 这是我们生活中常遇到的问题


> You want to do X, and you think Y is the best way of doing so. Instead of asking about X, you ask about Y.

> — *from [Re: sequencial file naming](https://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=87035) by [Abigail](https://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=19977)*

* 你想去解决问题X, 但你觉得Y是最好的方式.没有去问别人X应该怎么做, 而是问了Y应该怎么做.
* 

> You're trying to do X, and you thought of solution Y. So you're asking about solution Y, without even mentioning X. The problem is, there might be a better solution, but we can't know that unless you describe what X is.

* 你想要去解决X, 但是你认为Y是最好的解决方案. 于是你提了很多解决Y的问题, 却丝毫没有提到X.于是问题就来了: 除非你对X做了问题描述, 即使找到了在Y上更好的解决方案, 也可能对X丝毫没有帮助.
* 


> To answer question Y, without understanding larger problem (the context) X, will most likely *not* help them entirely with X.

* 有人在还没有真正理解更严重更重要的问题X时, 去问了问题Y, 这很大可能上对Ta在问题X上完全没有帮助.
* 

> A.k.a. "premature closure": the questioner wanted to solve some not very clearly stated X, they concluded that Y was a component of a solution, and now they're asking how to implement Y.

* “过早的关闭/(premature conclusion 国语里过早地下结论比较贴合)”

> The XY problem is when you need to do X, and you think you can use Y to do X, so you ask about how to do Y, when what you really should do is state what your X problem is. There may be a Z solution that is even better than Y, but nobody can suggest it if X is never mentioned.
